# Code Test: Utilities for Property Caching, Reverse File Reading, and Transaction Reconciliation

This repository was created as a response to a coding test. It contains three self-contained Python modules, each with its own functionality, tests, and benchmarks.

## ðŸ§© Modules

### 1. `reconcile_accounts`

Efficiently compares two lists of financial transactions and reconciles each row by matching on department, amount, payee, and date (with Â±1 day tolerance).

### 2. `last_lines`

A UTF-8-safe file reader that retrieves the last lines of a large text file without loading the entire content into memory. 

### 3. `computed_property`

A decorator for defining computed, cached properties in Python classes.
